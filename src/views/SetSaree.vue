              <p>Kerala saree is specially known as the saree of either white or cream with kasavu (golden threads). The process
of making this saree involves the constant hardships of the weaver during all the steps of making it. Cotton yarns
are generally brought from the Salem regions of Tamilnadu and Sari threads from Surat. The cotton yarn of the
roll form are wound to the small pirns for the weft purpose and immersed in the kanji liquid for stiffness purpose.
Sari threads are wound to the small pirns for the design and weft purpose.
In case of the cotton yarn they are rolled on the beam and knotted to the previous yarns firmly by dipping the
fingers into the melted wax to avoid the slipperiness of the fingers. The yarns are then extended and the beam is
placed on the loom for weaving.</p>
<p>Sari threads from the bobbins are passed through the eyelets and rolled on to the warping beams. The eyelets
moves from one end to the other end of the warping frame, there by winding about three mona said in the local
language (i.e. one set of the top and the bottom threads of the warp). Thereby continuously changing the bobbins till the required length is obtained. The Sari threads are then knotted to the previous threads and in between dip the fingers in the melted wax for the strong knotting. The Sari threads are extended and applied with
wax from one end to the other for stiffness purpose. After the cotton yarn and the Sari threads are inserted and
tightened to the required length. The weaving process begins with the controlled mechanism of the Jacquard for
the insertion of the patterns.
Though weaving is done on the handlooms mostly, the saree woven on the power looms from the Erode and
Salem regions are brought to Kuthampully for the final works of the printing. The method followed is the screen
printing where the films of the designs are sent from Tirupur and the screens are set here. As per requirement,
the screen is cleaned properly with the wet cloth and then the colour paste made is spread evenly to imprint the
design on the fabric that is placed firmly to the table with the chalk powder and the sticker gum.
Most of the time the fabric observed is rough therefore they are sent through the calendering process to obtain
a smooth finish. The fabric is then folded, pressed and packed to be sold or exported to the places wherever the
Keralites live in the world.</p>

                </p>


                <p>Our weavers design the most elegant clothes with an emphasis on the texture, thread and weave. Ekatva products are weaved from the traditional cotton weaver's
                  <strong>Kuthampully</strong> village located in Thiruvilwamala Grama Panchayat of Thrissur district of Kerala. Traditional handloom is part and parcel of the village life in Kuthampully in Thrissur district. The forefathers of Kuthampully came from Mysore about 500 years ago, to weave clothes for the erstwhile dynasty of Cochin and they never returned to their native place. They followed the traditional path in the early days and the different kinds of attires they created, like the kasavu double dhoti, veshti and set mundu became popular. Later on, embroidery techniques were deftly applied on traditional Kuthampully sarees to produce designer ones. We design designers saree also as per request which is unique to the occasion and with all contemporary and modern style.
