                  Ekatva Collections brings to you a unique selection of traditional
                  <strong>Kerala handloom and ethnic products</strong> to our patrons. Kerala traditional wear has always had a special place in the hearts of fashion conscious Indian women and men.Kerala Saree also known as the kasavu saree the traditional wear of the Keralites is seen worn by the women during different occasions and festivals. Traditional wears of Kerala are the Kerala Set-Saree, Set-Mundu, Neriyath,
Kavani, Kasava etc. These traditional wears are specially made at Kuthampully of the Thrissur district of Kerala
in India.Kerala Saree generally is of a single piece of cloth where as traditional mundum neriyathum is of a two piece
cloth. It is considered as the cultural costume of the Malayali community with the beauty and charm of the golden borders with the plain white mundum neriyathum. Now days this is mostly draped in the nivi or the national
style of draping. Traditionally it is said that the mundum neriyathum was worn with the neriyathu tucked inside
the blouse.
The coloured strip at the border are referred to as Kara, the piece of cloth that drapes the lower garment is
called mundu and the upper garment called the neriyathu. One end of the neriyathu is worn over a blouse that is
tucked inside the pavadai or petticoat with the left behind long end of neriyathu is worn diagonally to the front
torso

                <p>
                  Our weavers design the most elegant clothes with an emphasis on the texture, thread and weave. Ekatva products are weaved from the traditional cotton weaver's
                  <strong>Kuthampully</strong> village located in Thiruvilwamala Grama Panchayat of Thrissur district of Kerala. Traditional handloom is part and parcel of the village life in Kuthampully in Thrissur district. The forefathers of Kuthampully came from Mysore about 500 years ago, to weave clothes for the erstwhile dynasty of Cochin and they never returned to their native place. They followed the traditional path in the early days and the different kinds of attires they created, like the kasavu double dhoti, veshti and set mundu became popular. Later on, embroidery techniques were deftly applied on traditional Kuthampully sarees to produce designer ones. We design designers saree also as per request which is unique to the occasion and with all contemporary and modern style.

                <p>Kuthampully is a traditional cotton weaver's village located on the banks of the river Bharathapuzha in the Thrissur district of Kerala. In 1972, Kuthampully Handloom Industrial Cooperative Society was registered with 102 members. The tradition of Kuthampully handloom was started many years ago by a few weavers (Devengas) from Mysore who were asked to weave dresses for the Maharaja of Cochin. These weavers were the Devengas who are typically the South Indian weaver community. Now it has 814 members with own building in Kuthampully. In September 2011, the Kuthampully Saree got exclusive Intellectual Property rights through Geographical indication Act.</p>
                <p>At present, there are about 800 families who are still engaged in the weaving process of Kuthampully handloom. They are gentle, warm and quiet and are catering to Malayali's all around the world. Every house has its own handloom machine. The Kuthampully sarees is the traditional dress of Kerala for many years now. The sarees are different from the regular sarees because of the golden embroidery. The texture of the saree depends on the type of thread, thickness and style of weaving. The Kuthuampully village is well known for its Kasavu sarees, mundu, set sarees and dhotis. The products are known for its quality, durability and simplicity.</p>
